Hi Everyone, 

Now that we are all together as the Digital Excellence in Health (DxH) Portfolio, we are launching our Digital Excellence in Health Portfolio Teams. It will be a space for you to access information and resources, to get to know your team members and keep a pulse with what’s new in our portfolio.

On our Portfolio Teams, you will be able to find:
•	Files Tab: Documents and any relevant portfolio information and updates. 
•	Wiki Tab: Resources and other useful information such as answers to questions from Town Halls and upcoming portfolio-specific resources and training, such as Gartner. 
•	General Posts Tab: Reminders and announcements to keep you informed. 
•	Virtual Suggestion Box Tab: Where you can enter your questions, concerns, feedback and/or suggestions to make improvements on your work experience. We strongly encourage you to provide us with your feedback or suggestions as often as you like. Answers will be posted in our new Teams site.

ACTION: Let’s put our DxH Virtual Suggestion Box to use!  Please submit any questions you may have for our upcoming Town Hall by Wednesday, October 21, 2020. 
This is an exciting time for our portfolio, and I am very happy to share this space with you. To ensure our Teams space meets the needs of our portfolio, we plan to bring together an employee advisory team to support our ongoing efforts, including future Town Hall agendas and the Teams site. Please stay tuned for more information at our upcoming Town Hall on Thursday!

Should you have any questions or concerns, please connect with Vanessa Jeromans.

Hello,

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, some areas across Ontario Health have identified an immediate need for resources to support our COVID-19 response. This is a call for resources available to be immediately redeployed to support this important work. 

The attached “Redeployment Role Listing” identifies the positions we are seeking to fill right now, including available information on functions and required skill sets. All roles are virtual positions and the majority are full-time. Interested individuals must be available immediately, for a minimum of three months. Once confirmed, people will receive a letter confirming their temporary redeployment; all other terms and conditions of their employment remain the same. 

If you have an interest and skill set based on the attached information, please connect with your manager. If you are interested in more than one position, please rank your preferences. The senior team within our portfolio will review all expressions of interest to support this rapid deployment, and we will submit consolidated portfolio suggestions to Human Resources for evaluation and placement.

You will be notified next week if you will be redeployed in this phase. Due to the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 situation, there may be ongoing shifts in the positions and skills required. 

The deadline for expressions of interest to your manager is 2:00 p.m. on Friday, October 16th. 

If you have any questions, please contact your manager.

Thank you for your support.

Good morning,
	
It is with mixed emotions that I announce that Chris Pentleton, our VP and Chief Architect, has resigned from Ontario Health, as of December 31, 2020. Chris joined the legacy Digital Services (aka eHealth Ontario) in July 2018. Prior to joining eHealth Ontario, he spent many years at the Ministry of Health Health Service Cluster. In both roles, Chris has led many initiatives, lending his knowledge and expertise in development of provincial scale information technology solutions that support our citizens and healthcare providers in accessing health information where and when they need it. He has brought fresh thinking and new ideas to solving our IT challenges to achieve modern digital platforms. Chris is now taking his skill, expertise, and enthusiasm to modernize digital platforms to other large-scale opportunities. 
 
I want to thank Chris for his contributions to building our Digital Excellence in Health portfolio and working tirelessly to improve the healthcare system through integrated digital solutions. Please join me in wishing Chris all the best.
 
Angela
