Hello and welcome everyone had to? our September all team virtual town hall. I hope you all have spent time to get outside this summer taking break to be with friends and family, hopefully just for relax, breath to recharge.

Last time we came together like this was back in June, so I am grabbing the opportunity to connect today here about whatâ€™s been going on since then. Sure many people are still in process of joining us in here. While they do, I am just gonna quickly and briefly cover a few having picked items of tracing over the maps/math and sharing the update.

First as you can see in your screen, this is our promised agenda for this afternoon.
